External Sorting of Files using ASYNCIO 

As the Data in Unsorted Input Files is very less the asyncio has minimal optimization , the performance improves significantly with large set of input data for the async_code , also no wait()/delay()/sleep() has been used in the sync and async code for the assignment as there wasn't any instruction to use them , but using them for the same set of input the async perform way better than the sync code.
